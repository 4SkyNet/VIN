Requires:
Theano

For generating the gridworld data, also requires:
Matlab BGL: http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/10922-matlabbgl
Put it in matlab_bgl folder.
Matlab 2015 required for calling python objects for visualizing trajectories.

To start: the scripts directory contains scripts for generating the data, 
and training the different models. 

Generating the data is not necessary. The data directory contains sample data 
(randomly generated maps) for training the models.
